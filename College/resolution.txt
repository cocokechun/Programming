Health:
1. Do not let my eyes get worse!! That means I cannot exhaust my eyes. I must stick to good habits.
2. Lose weight!! Currently I weigh around 54.5 kg right now. My goal is to reach 50 kg! That spells for healthy and well-controlled diet and constant exercise!
School:
1. Continue and finish the android app. 不能半途而弃！最基本的要求是能自己放在android手机里面用。In fact there are existing similar apps in the app store, but no matter whether we would make the app good enough to put it in the app store, I would still like to see a good functional app.
2. Be better at coding! Do more codeforces or competition programming problems. At least one per week.
3. Read more books!! Please read one book a month, just like your middle school!
4. Be more exposed to news, especially politics!
Career:
1. Decide which team to go in Google and have a good start in career!
2. Besides work, I must have a side project!!
Life:
1. Travel more in Europe!!! Manage my time well and make meaningful trips!
2. Learn some German cuisine! I should start filling my recipe book! I only had one entry
3. Be a better photographer! Take more pictures and be better at photoshop! Learn more photography techniques and read more photography stuff.
4. Be more organized in general. Clean room once a week. Keep files and folders organized.
Beauty:
1. Better skin, better life! Remember to do skincare every day.
2. Always dress clean and well. 这一点要特别向日本的女生学习.
Finance:
1. Learn to manage my money! At least I should how much I roughly spend each month… Especially after I make money and become entirely financially independent, I should really know financial input and output! It is better to keep an account book.
